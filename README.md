# ZO-clipped-SSTM

This is the code for the experiments from the paper "Accelerated Zeroth-order Method for Non-Smooth Stochastic Convex Optimization Problem with Infinite Variance". Files:

— Zeroth_order_backward_sstm.ipynb — Jupyter Notebook for running the experiments with clipped SSTM on synthetic data

— Graphs.ipynb — Jupyter Notebook for making the plots

— graph_plot_tools.py — functions for making the plots

— optimizers.py — implementation of clipped-SSTM and clipped-SGD in PyTorch

— utils.py — helper functions
